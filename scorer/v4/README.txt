NAME
   CorScorer: Perl package for scoring coreference resolution systems
   using different metrics.


VERSION
   1.06


INSTALLATION
   Requirements:
      1. Perl: downloadable from http://perl.org
      2. Algorithm-Munkres: included in this package and downloadable
         from CPAN http://search.cpan.org/~tpederse/Algorithm-Munkres-0.08

USE
   This package is distributed with two scripts to execute the scorer from
   the command line.

   Windows (tm): scorer.bat
   Linux: scorer.pl


SYNOPSIS
   use CorScorer;

   $metric = 'ceafm';

   # Scores the whole dataset
   &CorScorer::Score($metric, $keys_file, $response_file);

   # Scores one file
   &CorScorer::Score($metric, $keys_file, $response_file, $name);


INPUT
   metric: the metric desired to score the results:
	   muc: MUCScorer (Vilain et al, 1995)
	   bcub: B-Cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)
	   ceafm: CEAF (Luo et al, 2005) using mention-based similarity
	   ceafe: CEAF (Luo et al, 2005) using entity-based similarity
	   blanc: BLANC (Recasens and Hovy, doi: 10.1017/S135132491000029X)
	   all: uses all the metrics to score

   keys_file: file with expected coreference chains in SemEval format

   response_file: file with output of coreference system (SemEval format)

   name: [optional] the name of the document to score. If name is not
	   given, all the documents in the dataset will be scored. If given
	   name is "none" then all the documents are scored but only total
	   results are shown.


OUTPUT
   The score subroutine returns an array with four values in this order:
   1) Recall numerator
   2) Recall denominator
   3) Precision numerator
   4) Precision denominator

   Also recall, precision and F1 are printed in the standard output when variable
   $VERBOSE is not null.

   Final scores:
   Recall = recall_numerator / recall_denominator
   Precision = precision_numerator / precision_denominator
   F1 = 2 * Recall * Precision / (Recall + Precision)

   Identification of mentions
   An scorer for identification of mentions (recall, precision and F1) is also included.
   Mentions from system response are compared with key mentions. There are two kind of
   positive matching response mentions:

   a) Strictly correct identified mentions: Tokens included in response mention are exactly
   the same tokens included in key mention.

   b) Partially correct identified mentions: Response mention tokens include the head token
   of the key mention and no new tokens are added (i.e. the key mention bounds are not 
   overcome).


   The partially correct mentions can be given some credit (for
   example, a weight of 0.5) to get a combined score as follows:

   Recall = (a + 0.5 * b) / #key mentions
   Precision = (a + 0.5 * b) / #response mentions
   F1 = 2 * Recall * Precision / (Recall + Precision)

   For the official CoNLL evaluation, however, we will only consider
   mentions with exact boundaries as being correct.
